# XCVB

eXtensible Component Verifier and Builder for Common-Lisp.

XCVB is a Common Lisp build system.

## Status

XCVB hasn't seen much development since 2012. It works, but it has not
reached its full potential.

I don't intend to maintain XCVB anymore unless there is funding for it.
Considering the extremely conservative nature of the Common Lisp community,
an incremental evolution to do things with an ASDF 4 would be more likely
to succeed, too. See the ASDF TODO file for that.

XCVB was originally written with ASDF 1, and it was meant to eventually
replace ASDF. Due to various circumstances, my efforts have shifted
towards developing ASDF itself, which has much evolved since those times.

That said, if you're going to write a next generation build system in and/or
for Common Lisp, there is probably plenty of ideas and maybe even code to
salvage from XCVB and its own TODO.
