;; We rely on the same approximation as make and asdf.
;; If the modified file is a generated file a previous version of which
;; was last generated and compiled in the same second, you lose. Unlikely, though.
;; More likely, if you have object files from the recent past and
;; unpack a source code update from a further past (as archived), you lose.
;; Or, if your (file)system clock is skewed and produces object files in the past
;; of the source code, you may lose in strange ways by rebuilding too much.
